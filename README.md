You can get the json files at https://dadosabertos.camara.leg.br/swagger/api.html#staticfile

The files you need are:
- proposicoes-2022.json
- proposicoesAutores-2022.json
- votacoesObjetos-2022.json
- votacoesVotos-2022.json

Put these files inside the "json" directory and enjoy!

OBS: This solution is VERY SLOW. I am NOT a web developer, this was the best I could do.

And no, I will not allow this shitty code into my main GitHub repo, which is -> https://github.com/mikurindotc
